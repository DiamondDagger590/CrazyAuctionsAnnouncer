### Main Config For CAA ###
##########################
#
#Notes:
#    Do not use ' or " in messages as I have not yet added support for these icons.
#   - Do not remove any lines as that will throw errors
#   - This plugin only supports Minecraft color codes. Ex) &eHello World&7!
#       - Use this link for a list of the codes: https://wiki.ess3.net/mc/
#   - If you want a message to be blank, please leave it as ''
#   - This plugin supports the following placeholders
#         - Players: %Player%
#         - Items: %Item%
#         - Money: %Money%
#         - AuctionType: %AuctionType%
#         - Amount: %Amount%
#         - DisplayName: %DisplayName% (Please note that if the item does not have a display name this will return the item material instead
# If you receive an error when CAA loads, ensure that:
#   - No tabs are present: YAML only allows spaces
#   - Indents are correct: YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
